Welcome to Conway's Game of Life!

| Project Details |
-------------------

The point of this project is to practice my C++ skills on something
more tangible and visual than most of what I have been creating prior. It
stating with me asking ChatGPT is a project like this was possible for 
someone who is a beginner - intermediate in C++, and to my surprise it 
said it was completely possible! Since then I got the confidence to create
this game. Everything you see in here is built from scratch all in an 
effort to learn, grow, and develop as a Software Engineer.

---------

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by
   underpopulation.

2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next
   generation.

3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as it by 
   overpopulation

4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell,
   as if by reproduction

The Game of Life, also known as Conway's Game of Life or simply Life, is a 
cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway
in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined
by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game
of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolved. It 
is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other 
Turing machine.
